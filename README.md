Google Foobar challenges

I got invited to do Foobar challenges when I searched RAII on Google. ^^ The choice of programming language was between Java and Python. I know both but I also know what I prefer recreationally.

I ran into some time problems when I did a problem involving a Markov chain which I did not know how to do but otherwise it was pretty cool advancing on these problems. When your time runs out you can't continue solving the problems, otherwise I would have. Not having done all the problems was a surefire way of not getting any recruiter contact from Google. Maybe some day. I heard the program has been discontinued now?
